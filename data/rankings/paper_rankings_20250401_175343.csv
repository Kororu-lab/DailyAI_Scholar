1,Pro-Routing: Proactive Routing of Autonomous Multi-Capacity Robots for Pickup-and-Delivery Tasks,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24325v1,1.44,2,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"We consider a multi-robot setting, where we have a fleet of multi-capacity autonomous robots that must service spatially distributed pickup-and-delivery requests with fixed maximum wait times. Requests can be either scheduled ahead of time or they can enter the system in real-time. In this setting, stability for a routing policy is defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time. Most previous work either solve the problem offline to theoretically maintain stability or they consider dynamically arriving requests at the expense of the theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel proactive rollout-based routing framework that adapts to real-time demand while still provably maintaining the stability of the learned routing policy. We derive provable stability guarantees for our method by proposing a fleet sizing algorithm that obtains a sufficiently large fleet that ensures stability by construction. To validate our theoretical results, we consider a case study on real ride requests for Harvard's evening Van System. We also evaluate the performance of our framework using the currently deployed smaller fleet size. In this smaller setup, we compare against the currently deployed routing algorithm, greedy heuristics, and Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-based algorithms. Our empirical results show that our framework maintains stability when we use the sufficiently large fleet size found in our theoretical results. For the smaller currently deployed fleet size, our method services 6% more requests than the closest baseline while reducing median passenger wait times by 33%."
2,Graph-Eq: Discovering Mathematical Equations using Graph Generative Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23617v1,1.3599999999999999,3,"cs.LG, cs.AI, I.2",2025-03-30,2025-03-30,"The ability to discover meaningful, accurate, and concise mathematical equations that describe datasets is valuable across various domains. Equations offer explicit relationships between variables, enabling deeper insights into underlying data patterns. Most existing equation discovery methods rely on genetic programming, which iteratively searches the equation space but is often slow and prone to overfitting. By representing equations as directed acyclic graphs, we leverage the use of graph neural networks to learn the underlying semantics of equations, and generate new, previously unseen equations. Although graph generative models have been shown to be successful in discovering new types of graphs in many fields, there application in discovering equations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose Graph-EQ, a deep graph generative model designed for efficient equation discovery. Graph-EQ uses a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) to learn a rich latent representation of the equation space by training it on a large corpus of equations in an unsupervised manner. Instead of directly searching the equation space, we employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore this learned latent space. We show that the encoder-decoder architecture of Graph-Eq is able to accurately reconstruct input equations. Moreover, we show that the learned latent representation can be sampled and decoded into valid equations, including new and previously unseen equations in the training data. Finally, we assess Graph-Eq's ability to discover equations that best fit a dataset by exploring the latent space using Bayesian optimization. Latent space exploration is done on 20 dataset with known ground-truth equations, and Graph-Eq is shown to successfully discover the grountruth equation in the majority of datasets."
3,KOFFVQA: An Objectively Evaluated Free-form VQA Benchmark for Large Vision-Language Models in the Korean Language,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23730v1,1.3400000000000003,2,"cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"The recent emergence of Large Vision-Language Models(VLMs) has resulted in a variety of different benchmarks for evaluating such models. Despite this, we observe that most existing evaluation methods suffer from the fact that they either require the model to choose from pre-determined responses, sacrificing open-endedness, or evaluate responses using a judge model, resulting in subjective and unreliable evaluation. In addition, we observe a lack of benchmarks for VLMs in the Korean language, which are necessary as a separate metric from more common English language benchmarks, as the performance of generative language models can differ significantly based on the language being used. Therefore, we present KOFFVQA, a general-purpose free-form visual question answering benchmark in the Korean language for the evaluation of VLMs. Our benchmark consists of 275 carefully crafted questions each paired with an image and grading criteria covering 10 different aspects of VLM performance. The grading criteria eliminate the problem of unreliability by allowing the judge model to grade each response based on a pre-determined set of rules. By defining the evaluation criteria in an objective manner, even a small open-source model can be used to evaluate models on our benchmark reliably. In addition to evaluating a large number of existing VLMs on our benchmark, we also experimentally verify that our method of using pre-existing grading criteria for evaluation is much more reliable than existing methods.

In practice, there can be substantial uncertainty about the distribution of new data, and corresponding variability in the performance of existing predictors. Building on the theory of partial identification and transportability, this paper introduces new results for bounding the value of a functional of the target distribution, such as the generalization error of a classifier, given data from source domains and assumptions about the data generating mechanisms, encoded in causal diagrams. Our contribution is to provide the first general estimation technique for transportability problems, adapting existing parameterization schemes such Neural Causal Models to encode the structural constraints necessary for cross-population inference. We demonstrate the expressiveness and consistency of this procedure and further propose a gradient-based optimization scheme for making scalable inferences in practice. Our results are corroborated with experiments."
5,Addressing Model Overcomplexity in Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction With Molecular Fingerprints,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23550v1,1.3400000000000003,2,"q-bio.BM, cs.AI, cs.LG",2025-03-30,2025-03-30,"Accurately predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is crucial for pharmaceutical research and clinical safety. Recent deep learning models often suffer from high computational costs and limited generalization across datasets. In this study, we investigate a simpler yet effective approach using molecular representations such as Morgan fingerprints (MFPS), graph-based embeddings from graph convolutional networks (GCNs), and transformer-derived embeddings from MoLFormer integrated into a straightforward neural network. We benchmark our implementation on DrugBank DDI splits and a drug-drug affinity (DDA) dataset from the Food and Drug Administration. MFPS along with MoLFormer and GCN representations achieve competitive performance across tasks, even in the more challenging leak-proof split, highlighting the sufficiency of simple molecular representations. Moreover, we are able to identify key molecular motifs and structural patterns relevant to drug interactions via gradient-based analyses using the representations under study. Despite these results, dataset limitations such as insufficient chemical diversity, limited dataset size, and inconsistent labeling impact robust evaluation and challenge the need for more complex approaches. Our work provides a meaningful baseline and emphasizes the need for better dataset curation and progressive complexity scaling."
6,Effectively Controlling Reasoning Models through Thinking Intervention,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24370v1,1.32,4,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Reasoning-enhanced large language models (LLMs) explicitly generate intermediate reasoning steps prior to generating final answers, helping the model excel in complex problem-solving. In this paper, we demonstrate that this emerging generation framework offers a unique opportunity for more fine-grained control over model behavior. We propose Thinking Intervention, a novel paradigm designed to explicitly guide the internal reasoning processes of LLMs by strategically inserting or revising specific thinking tokens. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across multiple tasks, including instruction following on IFEval, instruction hierarchy on SEP, and safety alignment on XSTest and SORRY-Bench. Our results demonstrate that Thinking Intervention significantly outperforms baseline prompting approaches, achieving up to 6.7% accuracy gains in instruction-following scenarios, 15.4% improvements in reasoning about instruction hierarchies, and a 40.0% increase in refusal rates for unsafe prompts using open-source DeepSeek R1 models. Overall, our work opens a promising new research avenue for controlling reasoning LLMs."
7,SQuat: Subspace-orthogonal KV Cache Quantization,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24358v1,1.32,4,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.IT, math.IT",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"The key-value (KV) cache accelerates LLMs decoding by storing KV tensors from previously generated tokens. It reduces redundant computation at the cost of increased memory usage. To mitigate this overhead, existing approaches compress KV tensors into lower-bit representations; however, quantization errors can accumulate as more tokens are generated, potentially resulting in undesired outputs. In this paper, we introduce SQuat (Subspace-orthogonal KV cache quantization). It first constructs a subspace spanned by query tensors to capture the most critical task-related information. During key tensor quantization, it enforces that the difference between the (de)quantized and original keys remains orthogonal to this subspace, minimizing the impact of quantization errors on the attention mechanism's outputs. SQuat requires no model fine-tuning, no additional calibration dataset for offline learning, and is grounded in a theoretical framework we develop. Through numerical experiments, we show that our method reduces peak memory by 2.17 to 2.82, improves throughput by 2.45 to 3.60, and achieves more favorable benchmark scores than existing KV cache quantization algorithms."
8,ORAL: Prompting Your Large-Scale LoRAs via Conditional Recurrent Diffusion,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24354v1,1.32,5,"cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Parameter generation has emerged as a novel paradigm for neural network development, offering an alternative to traditional neural network training by synthesizing high-quality model weights directly. In the context of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for evolving ($\textit{i.e.}$, constantly updated) large language models (LLMs), this approach promises efficient adaptation without costly retraining. However, existing methods face critical limitations in simultaneously achieving scalability and controllability. In this paper, we introduce $\texttt{ORAL}$, a novel $\textbf{conditional recurrent diffusion}$ framework that addresses these challenges. $\texttt{ORAL}$ incorporates a novel conditioning mechanism that integrates model architecture and textual task specifications, enabling the generation of task-specific LoRA parameters that can seamlessly transfer across evolving foundation models. Our approach successfully scales to billions-of-parameter LLMs and maintains controllability. Through extensive experiments across seven language tasks, four vision tasks, and three multimodal tasks using five pre-trained LLMs, we demonstrate that $\texttt{ORAL}$ generates high-quality LoRA parameters that achieve comparable or superior performance to vanilla trained counterparts."

Building upon the BEATS framework, we present a bias benchmark for LLMs that measure performance across 29 distinct metrics. These metrics span a broad range of characteristics, including demographic, cognitive, and social biases, as well as measures of ethical reasoning, group fairness, and factuality related misinformation risk. These metrics enable a quantitative assessment of the extent to which LLM generated responses may perpetuate societal prejudices that reinforce or expand systemic inequities. To achieve a high score on this benchmark a LLM must show very equitable behavior in their responses, making it a rigorous standard for responsible AI evaluation. Empirical results based on data from our experiment show that, 37.65\% of outputs generated by industry leading models contained some form of bias, highlighting a substantial risk of using these models in critical decision making systems. BEATS framework and benchmark offer a scalable and statistically rigorous methodology to benchmark LLMs, diagnose factors driving biases, and develop mitigation strategies. With the BEATS framework, our goal is to help the development of more socially responsible and ethically aligned AI models."
10,Value of Information-based Deceptive Path Planning Under Adversarial Interventions,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24284v1,1.32,5,"cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Existing methods for deceptive path planning (DPP) address the problem of designing paths that conceal their true goal from a passive, external observer. Such methods do not apply to problems where the observer has the ability to perform adversarial interventions to impede the path planning agent. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov decision process (MDP)-based model for the DPP problem under adversarial interventions and develop new value of information (VoI) objectives to guide the design of DPP policies. Using the VoI objectives we propose, path planning agents deceive the adversarial observer into choosing suboptimal interventions by selecting trajectories that are of low informational value to the observer. Leveraging connections to the linear programming theory for MDPs, we derive computationally efficient solution methods for synthesizing policies for performing DPP under adversarial interventions. In our experiments, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution method in achieving deceptiveness under adversarial interventions and demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to both existing DPP methods and conservative path planning approaches on illustrative gridworld problems."

It primarily decreases the memory consumption of \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} to reduce the computation cost. Despite the development of many compression algorithms, their applications in production environments are still not prevalent. In this paper, we revisit mainstream \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression solutions from a practical perspective. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we comprehensively review existing algorithmic designs and benchmark studies for \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression and identify missing pieces in their performance measurement, which could hinder their adoption in practice. Second, we empirically evaluate representative \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression methods to uncover two key issues that affect the computational efficiency: (1) while compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} can reduce memory consumption, current implementations (e.g., FlashAttention, PagedAttention) do not optimize for production-level LLM serving, resulting in suboptimal throughput performance; (2) compressing \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} may lead to longer outputs, resulting in increased end-to-end latency. We further investigate the accuracy performance of individual samples rather than the overall performance, revealing the intrinsic limitations in \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression when handling specific LLM tasks. Third, we provide tools to shed light on future \texttt{KV} \texttt{cache} compression studies and facilitate their practical deployment in production.

12,LANID: LLM-assisted New Intent Discovery,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23740v1,1.32,4,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Task-oriented Dialogue Systems (TODS) often face the challenge of encountering new intents. New Intent Discovery (NID) is a crucial task that aims to identify these novel intents while maintaining the capability to recognize existing ones. Previous efforts to adapt TODS to new intents have struggled with inadequate semantic representation or have depended on external knowledge, which is often not scalable or flexible. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities; however, their scale can be impractical for real-world applications that involve extensive queries. To address the limitations of existing NID methods by leveraging LLMs, we propose LANID, a framework that enhances the semantic representation of lightweight NID encoders with the guidance of LLMs. Specifically, LANID employs the $K$-nearest neighbors and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithms to sample selective utterance pairs from the training set. It then queries an LLM to ascertain the relationships between these pairs. The data produced from this process is utilized to design a contrastive fine-tuning task, which is then used to train a small encoder with a contrastive triplet loss. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across three distinct NID datasets, surpassing strong baselines in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings.

Since the primary goal of science is to understand the world around us, fully leveraging machine learning in scientific discovery requires models that are interpretable -- allowing experts to comprehend the concepts underlying machine-learned predictions. Successful interpretations increase trust in black-box methods, help reduce errors, allow for the improvement of the underlying models, enhance human-AI collaboration, and ultimately enable fully automated scientific discoveries that remain understandable to human scientists. This review examines the role of interpretability in machine learning applied to physics. We categorize different aspects of interpretability, discuss machine learning models in terms of both interpretability and performance, and explore the philosophical implications of interpretability in scientific inquiry. Additionally, we highlight recent advances in interpretable machine learning across many subfields of physics. By bridging boundaries between disciplines -- each with its own unique insights and challenges -- we aim to establish interpretable machine learning as a core research focus in science."

RLHF and related techniques typically involve constructing a dataset of binary or ranked choice human preferences and subsequently fine-tuning models to align with these preferences. This paper shifts the focus to understanding the preferences encoded in such datasets and identifying common human preferences. We find that a small subset of 21 preference categories (selected from a set of nearly 5,000 distinct preferences) captures >89% of preference variation across individuals. This small set of preferences is analogous to a canonical basis of human preferences, similar to established findings that characterize human variation in psychology or facial recognition studies. Through both synthetic and empirical evaluations, we confirm that our low-rank, canonical set of human preferences generalizes across the entire dataset and within specific topics. We further demonstrate our preference basis' utility in model evaluation, where our preference categories offer deeper insights into model alignment, and in model training, where we show that fine-tuning on preference-defined subsets successfully aligns the model accordingly."

Existing benchmarks quantify hallucinations using relatively small, labeled datasets. However, this approach is i) insufficient to assess hallucinations that arise in open-world settings, where VLMs are widely used, and ii) inadequate for detecting systematic errors in VLMs. We propose DASH (Detection and Assessment of Systematic Hallucinations), an automatic, large-scale pipeline designed to identify systematic hallucinations of VLMs on real-world images in an open-world setting. A key component is DASH-OPT for image-based retrieval, where we optimize over the ''natural image manifold'' to generate images that mislead the VLM. The output of DASH consists of clusters of real and semantically similar images for which the VLM hallucinates an object. We apply DASH to PaliGemma and two LLaVA-NeXT models across 380 object classes and, in total, find more than 19k clusters with 950k images. We study the transfer of the identified systematic hallucinations to other VLMs and show that fine-tuning PaliGemma with the model-specific images obtained with DASH mitigates object hallucinations.

However, little is still known about the potential of the resulting ``Large Reasoning Models'' (LRMs) beyond problem solving in mathematics and programming, where finding genuine out-of-distribution problems can be difficult. In this paper, we focus on tasks that require systematic reasoning about relational compositions, especially for qualitative spatial and temporal reasoning. These tasks allow us to control the difficulty of problem instances, and measure in a precise way to what extent models can generalise. We find that that the considered LLMs and LRMs overall perform poorly overall, albeit better than random chance."

The latter consists of spray-based printing of cementitious plaster on a wall and is facilitated with the use of a robotic arm. The predictions are computed using the robotic arm trajectory features, such as position, velocity and direction, as well as the printing process parameters. The proposed approach, based on a particle representation of the wall domain and the end effector, allows for the adoption of a graph-based solution. The GNN model consists of an encoder-processor-decoder architecture and is trained using data from laboratory tests, while the hyperparameters are optimized by means of a Bayesian scheme. The aim of this model is to act as a simulator of the printing process, and ultimately used for the generation of the robotic arm trajectory and the optimization of the printing parameters, towards the materialization of an autonomous plastering process. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the prediction error against unseen ground truth data, which shows its generality in varied scenarios, as well as in comparison with the performance of an existing benchmark model. The results demonstrate a significant improvement over the benchmark model, with notably better performance and enhanced error scaling across prediction steps."

SAEs are based on the linear representation hypothesis (LRH), which assumes that the representations of large language models (LLMs) are linearly encoded, and the superposition hypothesis (SH), which states that there can be more features in the model than its dimensionality. We show that, based on the formal definitions of the LRH and SH, the magnitude of sparse feature vectors (the latent representations learned by SAEs of the dense embeddings of LLMs) can be approximated using their corresponding dense vector with a closed-form error bound. To visualize this, we propose the ZF plot, which reveals a previously unknown relationship between LLM hidden embeddings and SAE feature vectors, allowing us to make the first empirical measurement of the extent to which feature vectors of pre-trained SAEs are over- or under-activated for a given input. Correspondingly, we introduce Approximate Feature Activation (AFA), which approximates the magnitude of the ground-truth sparse feature vector, and propose a new evaluation metric derived from AFA to assess the alignment between inputs and activations. We also leverage AFA to introduce a novel SAE architecture, the top-AFA SAE, leading to SAEs that: (a) are more in line with theoretical justifications; and (b) obviate the need to tune SAE sparsity hyperparameters. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that top-AFA SAEs achieve reconstruction loss comparable to that of state-of-the-art top-k SAEs, without requiring the hyperparameter $k$ to be tuned.

In the first stage, we construct a graph representation of each image, comprising object queries, class embeddings, and proposal locations. Then, our task-aware architecture processes this graph to perform the VG task.

However these data hungry complex systems are inherently black boxes and therefore slow to be adopted for high risk applications like healthcare. This problem of lack of transparency is exacerbated in the case of recent large foundation models, which are trained in a self supervised manner on millions of data points to provide robust generalisation across a range of downstream tasks, but the embeddings generated from them happen through a process that is not interpretable, and hence not easily trustable for clinical applications. To address this timely issue, we deploy conformal analysis to quantify the predictive uncertainty of a vision transformer (ViT) based foundation model across patient demographics with respect to sex, age and ethnicity for the tasks of skin lesion classification using several public benchmark datasets. The significant advantage of this method is that conformal analysis is method independent and it not only provides a coverage guarantee at population level but also provides an uncertainty score for each individual. We used a model-agnostic dynamic F1-score-based sampling during model training, which helped to stabilize the class imbalance and we investigate the effects on uncertainty quantification (UQ) with or without this bias mitigation step. Thus we show how this can be used as a fairness metric to evaluate the robustness of the feature embeddings of the foundation model (Google DermFoundation) and thus advance the trustworthiness and fairness of clinical AI."
23,Adaptive Layer-skipping in Pre-trained LLMs,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23798v1,1.2800000000000002,3,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Various layer-skipping methods have been proposed to accelerate token generation in large language models (LLMs). However, they have overlooked a fundamental question: How do computational demands vary across the generation of different tokens? In this work, we introduce FlexiDepth, a method that dynamically adjusts the number of Transformer layers used in text generation. By incorporating a plug-in router and adapter, FlexiDepth enables adaptive layer-skipping in LLMs without modifying their original parameters. Introducing FlexiDepth to Llama-3-8B model achieves layer skipping of 8 layers out of 32, and meanwhile maintains the full 100\% benchmark performance. Experimental results with FlexiDepth demonstrate that computational demands in LLMs significantly vary based on token type. Specifically, generating repetitive tokens or fixed phrases requires fewer layers, whereas producing tokens involving computation or high uncertainty requires more layers. Interestingly, this adaptive allocation pattern aligns with human intuition. To advance research in this area, we open sourced FlexiDepth and a dataset documenting FlexiDepth's layer allocation patterns for future exploration."

In this study, we introduce POINT$^{2}$ (POlymer INformatics Training and Testing), a comprehensive benchmark database and protocol designed to address these critical challenges. Leveraging the existing labeled datasets and the unlabeled PI1M dataset, a collection of approximately one million virtual polymers generated via a recurrent neural network trained on the realistic polymers, we develop an ensemble of ML models, including Quantile Random Forests, Multilayer Perceptrons with dropout, Graph Neural Networks, and pretrained large language models. These models are coupled with diverse polymer representations such as Morgan, MACCS, RDKit, Topological, Atom Pair fingerprints, and graph-based descriptors to achieve property predictions, uncertainty estimations, model interpretability, and template-based polymerization synthesizability across a spectrum of properties, including gas permeability, thermal conductivity, glass transition temperature, melting temperature, fractional free volume, and density.

Although biomedical research benefits from extensive datasets and established benchmarks, agrochemical data remain scarce, particularly with respect to species-specific toxicity. This work focuses on ApisTox, the most comprehensive dataset of experimentally validated chemical toxicity to the honey bee (\textit{Apis mellifera}), an ecologically vital pollinator. We evaluate ApisTox using a diverse suite of machine learning approaches, including molecular fingerprints, graph kernels, and graph neural networks, as well as pretrained models. Comparative analysis with medicinal datasets from the MoleculeNet benchmark reveals that ApisTox represents a distinct chemical space. Performance degradation on non-medicinal datasets, such as ApisTox, demonstrates their limited generalizability of current state-of-the-art algorithms trained solely on biomedical data. Our study highlights the need for more diverse datasets and for targeted model development geared toward the agrochemical domain."

Existing bias mitigation methods, such as Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) and Off- Policy Correction (OPC), primarily operate at the ranking stage or during training, lacking explicit real-time control over exposure dynamics. In this work, we introduce an exposure- aware retrieval scoring approach, which explicitly models item exposure probability and adjusts retrieval-stage ranking at inference time. Unlike prior work, this method decouples exposure effects from engagement likelihood, enabling controlled trade-offs between fairness and engagement in large-scale recommendation platforms. We validate our approach through online A/B experiments in a real-world video recommendation system, demonstrating a 25% increase in uniquely retrieved items and a 40% reduction in the dominance of over-popular content, all while maintaining overall user engagement levels. Our results establish a scalable, deployable solution for mitigating popularity bias at the retrieval stage, offering a new paradigm for bias-aware personalization."

This survey fills that gap by offering a comprehensive review of ULD, examining unlearnable data generation methods, public benchmarks, evaluation metrics, theoretical foundations and practical applications. We compare and contrast different ULD approaches, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and trade-offs related to unlearnability, imperceptibility, efficiency and robustness. Moreover, we discuss key challenges, such as balancing perturbation imperceptibility with model degradation and the computational complexity of ULD generation. Finally, we highlight promising future research directions to advance the effectiveness and applicability of ULD, underscoring its potential to become a crucial tool in the evolving landscape of data protection in machine learning."

Simulation with LLM powered agents is emerging as a promising alternative for representing human population behavior. However, LLMs are known to exhibit certain biases, such as brand bias, review rating bias and limited representation of certain groups in the population, hence they need to be carefully benchmarked and aligned to user behavior. Ultimately, our goal is to synthesise an agent population and verify that it collectively approximates a real sample of humans. To this end, we propose a framework that: (i) creates synthetic shopping agents by automatically mining personas from anonymised historical shopping data, (ii) equips agents with retail-specific tools to synthesise shopping sessions and (iii) introduces a novel alignment suite measuring distributional differences between humans and shopping agents at the group (i.e. population) level rather than the traditional ""individual"" level. Experimental results demonstrate that using personas improves performance on the alignment suite, though a gap remains to human behaviour. We showcase an initial application of our framework for automated agentic A/B testing and compare the findings to human results. Finally, we discuss applications, limitations and challenges setting the stage for impactful future work."

In this paper, we present DiET-GS, a diffusion prior and event stream-assisted motion deblurring 3DGS. Our framework effectively leverages both blur-free event streams and diffusion prior in a two-stage training strategy. Specifically, we introduce the novel framework to constraint 3DGS with event double integral, achieving both accurate color and well-defined details. Additionally, we propose a simple technique to leverage diffusion prior to further enhance the edge details.

Moreover, the cross-variate dependencies between them are multi-granular, with some covariates having a short-term impact on target variables and others showing long-term correlations. This heterogeneity and the intricate dependencies arising in covariate-informed forecasting present significant challenges to existing deep models. To address these issues, we propose CITRAS, a patch-based Transformer that flexibly leverages multiple targets and covariates covering both the past and the future forecasting horizon. While preserving the strong autoregressive capabilities of the canonical Transformer, CITRAS introduces two novel mechanisms in patch-wise cross-variate attention: Key-Value (KV) Shift and Attention Score Smoothing. KV Shift seamlessly incorporates future known covariates into the forecasting of target variables based on their concurrent dependencies. Additionally, Attention Score Smoothing transforms locally accurate patch-wise cross-variate dependencies into global variate-level dependencies by smoothing the past series of attention scores. Experimentally, CITRAS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both covariate-informed and multivariate forecasting, demonstrating its versatile ability to leverage cross-variate dependency for improved forecasting accuracy."

Yet Melanie Mitchell and others have questioned if the term still has meaning. AGI has been subject to so much hype and speculation it has become something of a Rorschach test. Mitchell points out that the debate will only be settled through long term, scientific investigation. To that end here is a short, accessible and provocative overview of AGI. I compare definitions of intelligence, settling on intelligence in terms of adaptation and AGI as an artificial scientist. Taking my queue from Sutton's Bitter Lesson I describe two foundational tools used to build adaptive systems: search and approximation. I compare pros, cons, hybrids and architectures like o3, AlphaGo, AERA, NARS and Hyperon. I then discuss overall meta-approaches to making systems behave more intelligently. I divide them into scale-maxing, simp-maxing, w-maxing based on the Bitter Lesson, Ockham's and Bennett's Razors. These maximise resources, simplicity of form, and the weakness of constraints on functionality. I discuss examples including AIXI, the free energy principle and The Embiggening of language models. I conclude that though scale-maxed approximation dominates, AGI will be a fusion of tools and meta-approaches. The Embiggening was enabled by improvements in hardware. Now the bottlenecks are sample and energy efficiency."

Skillful subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) forecasts -- beyond two weeks and up to two months -- can offer significant socioeconomic advantages to the energy sector. This study aims to enhance wind speed predictions using a diffusion model with classifier-free guidance to downscale S2S forecasts of surface wind speed. We propose DiffScale, a diffusion model that super-resolves spatial information for continuous downscaling factors and lead times. Leveraging weather priors as guidance for the generative process of diffusion models, we adopt the perspective of conditional probabilities on sampling super-resolved S2S forecasts. We aim to directly estimate the density associated with the target S2S forecasts at different spatial resolutions and lead times without auto-regression or sequence prediction, resulting in an efficient and flexible model. Synthetic experiments were designed to super-resolve wind speed S2S forecasts from the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from a coarse resolution to a finer resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data, which serves as a high-resolution target. The innovative aspect of DiffScale lies in its flexibility to downscale arbitrary scaling factors, enabling it to generalize across various grid resolutions and lead times -without retraining the model- while correcting model errors, making it a versatile tool for improving S2S wind speed forecasts. We achieve a significant improvement in prediction quality, outperforming baselines up to week 3."

This paper delves into the prediction of Origin-Destination (OD) demands at a fine-grained spatial level, especially when confronted with an expansive set of local regions. While this task holds immense practical value, it remains relatively unexplored within the research community. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel prediction model called OD-CED, which comprises an unsupervised space coarsening technique to alleviate data sparsity and an encoder-decoder architecture to capture both semantic and geographic dependencies. Through practical experimentation, OD-CED has demonstrated remarkable results. It achieved an impressive reduction of up to 45% reduction in root-mean-square error and 60% in weighted mean absolute percentage error over traditional statistical methods when dealing with OD matrices exhibiting a sparsity exceeding 90%."

Recent advances in diffusion models and rectified flows have significantly improved editing quality, primarily relying on inversion techniques to extract structured noise from input images. However, inaccuracies in inversion can propagate errors, leading to unintended modifications and compromising fidelity. Moreover, even with perfect inversion, the entanglement between textual prompts and image features often results in global changes when only local edits are intended. To address these challenges, we propose a novel text-guided image editing framework based on VAR (Visual AutoRegressive modeling), which eliminates the need for explicit inversion while ensuring precise and controlled modifications. Our method introduces a caching mechanism that stores token indices and probability distributions from the original image, capturing the relationship between the source prompt and the image. Using this cache, we design an adaptive fine-grained masking strategy that dynamically identifies and constrains modifications to relevant regions, preventing unintended changes. A token reassembling approach further refines the editing process, enhancing diversity, fidelity, and control. Our framework operates in a training-free manner and achieves high-fidelity editing with faster inference speeds, processing a 1K resolution image in as fast as 1.2 seconds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, or even surpassing, existing diffusion- and rectified flow-based approaches in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

The dataset is aimed at distilling the complex plan generation task into separate atomic reasoning tasks in their easiest possible form, boolean or multiple-choice questions, where the model has to choose the right answer from the provided options. While the aim of ACPBench is to test the simplest form of reasoning about action and change, when tasked with planning, a model does not typically have options to choose from and thus the reasoning required for planning dictates an open-ended, generative form for these tasks. To that end, we introduce ACPBench Hard, a generative version of ACPBench, with open-ended questions which the model needs to answer. Models that perform well on these tasks could in principle be integrated into a planner or be used directly as a policy. We discuss the complexity of these tasks as well as the complexity of validating the correctness of their answers and present validation algorithms for each task. Equipped with these validators, we test the performance of a variety of models on our tasks and find that for most of these tasks the performance of even the largest models is still subpar. Our experiments show that no model outperforms another in these tasks and with a few exceptions all tested language models score below 65%, indicating that even the current frontier language models have a long way to go before they can reliably reason about planning. In fact, even the so-called reasoning models struggle with solving these reasoning tasks. ACPBench Hard collection is available at the following link: https://ibm.github.io/ACPBench"

Fine-tuning achieves the highest accuracy (91% for emotion classification, 80% for mental health conditions) but requires substantial computational resources and large training sets, while prompt engineering and RAG offer more flexible deployment with moderate performance (40-68% accuracy).

It encodes images into a 3D Gaussian particle representation, propagates dynamics via a transformer, and renders frames using 3D Gaussian splatting. By jointly training inverse rendering with a dynamics transformer using a temporal encoding and merging layer, 3DGSimembeds physical properties into point-wise latent vectors without enforcing explicit connectivity constraints.

The reliability of counterfactual analysis in such settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate the limitations of counterfactual reasoning within the framework of Structural Causal Models. Specifically, we empirically investigate \emph{counterfactual sequence estimation} and highlight cases where it becomes increasingly unreliable. We find that realistic assumptions, such as low degrees of model uncertainty or chaotic dynamics, can result in counterintuitive outcomes, including dramatic deviations between predicted and true counterfactual trajectories. This work urges caution when applying counterfactual reasoning in settings characterized by chaos and uncertainty. Furthermore, it raises the question of whether certain systems may pose fundamental limitations on the ability to answer counterfactual questions about their behavior."

Thus, this paper makes the first attempt to synergize Reasoning and Imagination in an end-to-end Generalist policy, termed RIG. To train RIG in an end-to-end manner, we construct a data pipeline that progressively integrates and enriches the content of imagination and reasoning in the trajectories collected from existing agents. The joint learning of reasoning and next image generation explicitly models the inherent correlation between reasoning, action, and dynamics of environments, and thus exhibits more than $17\times$ sample efficiency improvements and generalization in comparison with previous works. During inference, RIG first reasons about the next action, produces potential action, and then predicts the action outcomes, which offers the agent a chance to review and self-correct based on the imagination before taking real actions. Experimental results show that the synergy of reasoning and imagination not only improves the robustness, generalization, and interoperability of generalist policy but also enables test-time scaling to enhance overall performance."

To make real-world evaluation of robotic policies more practical, we propose AutoEval, a system to autonomously evaluate generalist robot policies around the clock with minimal human intervention. Users interact with AutoEval by submitting evaluation jobs to the AutoEval queue, much like how software jobs are submitted with a cluster scheduling system, and AutoEval will schedule the policies for evaluation within a framework supplying automatic success detection and automatic scene resets. We show that AutoEval can nearly fully eliminate human involvement in the evaluation process, permitting around the clock evaluations, and the evaluation results correspond closely to ground truth evaluations conducted by hand. To facilitate the evaluation of generalist policies in the robotics community, we provide public access to multiple AutoEval scenes in the popular BridgeData robot setup with WidowX robot arms.

Parametric RAG (PRAG) addresses this by embedding document into LLMs parameters to perform test-time knowledge enhancement, effectively reducing inference costs through offline training. However, its high training and storage costs, along with limited generalization ability, significantly restrict its practical adoption. To address these challenges, we propose Dynamic Parametric RAG (DyPRAG), a novel framework that leverages a lightweight parameter translator model to efficiently convert documents into parametric knowledge.

As students increasingly turn to these tools to complete assessments, foundational cognitive skills are at risk of being bypassed, challenging the integrity of higher education and the authenticity of student work. Existing AI-generated text detection tools are inadequate; they produce unreliable outputs and are prone to both false positives and false negatives, especially when students apply paraphrasing, translation, or rewording. These systems rely on shallow statistical patterns rather than true contextual or semantic understanding, making them unsuitable as definitive indicators of AI misuse. In response, this research proposes a proactive, AI-resilient solution based on assessment design rather than detection. It introduces a web-based Python tool that integrates Bloom's Taxonomy with advanced natural language processing techniques including GPT-3.5 Turbo, BERT-based semantic similarity, and TF-IDF metrics to evaluate the AI-solvability of assessment tasks. By analyzing surface-level and semantic features, the tool helps educators determine whether a task targets lower-order thinking such as recall and summarization or higher-order skills such as analysis, evaluation, and creation, which are more resistant to AI automation. This framework empowers educators to design cognitively demanding, AI-resistant assessments that promote originality, critical thinking, and fairness. It offers a sustainable, pedagogically sound strategy to foster authentic learning and uphold academic standards in the age of AI."

Recent work proposes Set-Based Prompting (SBP) as a way to remove order information from designated token subsets, thereby mitigating positional biases. However, applying SBP on base models induces an out-of-distribution input format, which can degrade in-distribution performance. We introduce a fine-tuning strategy that integrates SBP into the training process, ""pulling"" these set-formatted prompts closer to the model's training manifold. We show that SBP can be incorporated into a model via fine-tuning. Our experiments on in-distribution (MMLU) and out-of-distribution (CSQA, ARC Challenge) multiple-choice tasks show that SBP fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy and robustness to answer-order permutations, all while preserving broader language modeling capabilities. We discuss the broader implications of order-invariant modeling and outline future directions for building fairer, more consistent LLMs."

This work systematically investigates the correlations between visual and textual tokens within the attention mechanisms of LVLMs. Our empirical analysis reveals considerable redundancy in cached visual tokens, wherein strategically eliminating these tokens preserves model performance while significantly accelerating context generation.

However, training neural networks in an RL regime is typically achieved in combination with backpropagation, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained environments or when using non-differentiable neural networks. While noise-based alternatives like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL) have been proposed, their performance has remained limited, especially in scenarios with delayed rewards, which require retrospective credit assignment over time. Here, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines directional derivative theory with Hebbian-like updates to enable efficient, gradient-free learning in RL. It features stochastic noisy neurons which can approximate gradients, and produces local synaptic updates modulated by a global reward signal. Drawing on concepts from neuroscience, our method uses reward prediction error as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate temporal credit assignment in environments with delayed rewards. Its formulation relies on local information alone, making it compatible with implementations in neuromorphic hardware. Experimental validation shows that our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and is competitive with BP-based baselines, highlighting the promise of noise-based, biologically inspired learning for low-power and real-time applications."

However, training a policy solely in simulation and transferring it to the real world often demands substantial human effort to bridge the reality gap. A compelling alternative is to co-train the policy on a mixture of simulation and real-world datasets. Preliminary studies have recently shown this strategy to substantially improve the performance of a policy over one trained on a limited amount of real-world data. Nonetheless, the community lacks a systematic understanding of sim-and-real co-training and what it takes to reap the benefits of simulation data for real-robot learning. This work presents a simple yet effective recipe for utilizing simulation data to solve vision-based robotic manipulation tasks. We derive this recipe from comprehensive experiments that validate the co-training strategy on various simulation and real-world datasets.

First, policies are constrained to a fixed number of actions per second due to hardware limitations. Second, the environment may change while the network is still computing an action, leading to observational delay. The first issue can partly be addressed with pipelining, leading to higher throughput and potentially better policies. However, the second issue remains: if each neuron operates in parallel with an execution time of $\tau$, an $N$-layer feed-forward network experiences observation delay of $\tau N$. Reducing the number of layers can decrease this delay, but at the cost of the network's expressivity. In this work, we explore the trade-off between minimizing delay and network's expressivity. We present a theoretically motivated solution that leverages temporal skip connections combined with history-augmented observations. We evaluate several architectures and show that those incorporating temporal skip connections achieve strong performance across various neuron execution times, reinforcement learning algorithms, and environments, including four Mujoco tasks and all MinAtar games.

For typical realizations of the network parameters, we study the properties of the energy landscape induced by this Hamiltonian, focusing on the structure of near-global minimum in the limit of infinite width. Specifically, we use the replica trick to perform an exact analytic calculation giving the entropy (log volume of space) at a given energy. We further derive saddle point equations that describe the overlaps between inputs sampled iid from the Gibbs distribution induced by the random MLP. For linear activations we solve these saddle point equations exactly. But we also solve them numerically for a variety of depths and activation functions, including $\tanh, \sin, \text{ReLU}$, and shaped non-linearities. We find even at infinite width a rich range of behaviors.

However, its subset, Human Image Aesthetic Assessment (HIAA), has been scarcely explored, even though HIAA is widely used in social media, AI workflows, and related domains. To bridge this research gap, our work pioneers a holistic implementation framework tailored for HIAA. Specifically, we introduce HumanBeauty, the first dataset purpose-built for HIAA, which comprises 108k high-quality human images with manual annotations. To achieve comprehensive and fine-grained HIAA, 50K human images are manually collected through a rigorous curation process and annotated leveraging our trailblazing 12-dimensional aesthetic standard, while the remaining 58K with overall aesthetic labels are systematically filtered from public datasets. Based on the HumanBeauty database, we propose HumanAesExpert, a powerful Vision Language Model for aesthetic evaluation of human images. We innovatively design an Expert head to incorporate human knowledge of aesthetic sub-dimensions while jointly utilizing the Language Modeling (LM) and Regression head. This approach empowers our model to achieve superior proficiency in both overall and fine-grained HIAA. Furthermore, we introduce a MetaVoter, which aggregates scores from all three heads, to effectively balance the capabilities of each head, thereby realizing improved assessment precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HumanAesExpert models deliver significantly better performance in HIAA than other state-of-the-art models. Our datasets, models, and codes are publicly released to advance the HIAA community. Project webpage: https://humanaesexpert.github.io/HumanAesExpert/"

For Discriminative models, we examine various architectures and hyperparameters during training and inference and identify energy-efficient practices. For Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs) are assessed, focusing primarily on energy consumption across different model sizes and varying service requests. Our study employs software-based power measurements, ensuring ease of replication across diverse configurations, models, and datasets. We analyse multiple models and hardware setups to uncover correlations among various metrics, identifying key contributors to energy consumption. The results indicate that for Discriminative models, optimising architectures, hyperparameters, and hardware can significantly reduce energy consumption without sacrificing performance. For LLMs, energy efficiency depends on balancing model size, reasoning complexity, and request-handling capacity, as larger models do not necessarily consume more energy when utilisation remains low. This analysis provides practical guidelines for designing green and sustainable ML operations, emphasising energy consumption and carbon footprint reductions while maintaining performance. This paper can serve as a benchmark for accurately estimating total energy use across different types of AI models."

However, existing benchmarks for evaluating video understanding exhibit significant limitations in coverage, task diversity, and scene adaptability. These shortcomings hinder the accurate assessment of models' comprehensive video understanding capabilities. To tackle this challenge, we propose a hierarchical and holistic video understanding (H2VU) benchmark designed to evaluate both general video and online streaming video comprehension. This benchmark contributes three key features:   Extended video duration: Spanning videos from brief 3-second clips to comprehensive 1.5-hour recordings, thereby bridging the temporal gaps found in current benchmarks. Comprehensive assessment tasks: Beyond traditional perceptual and reasoning tasks, we have introduced modules for countercommonsense comprehension and trajectory state tracking. These additions test the models' deep understanding capabilities beyond mere prior knowledge. Enriched video data: To keep pace with the rapid evolution of current AI agents, we have expanded first-person streaming video datasets. This expansion allows for the exploration of multimodal models' performance in understanding streaming videos from a first-person perspective. Extensive results from H2VU reveal that existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) possess substantial potential for improvement in our newly proposed evaluation tasks. We expect that H2VU will facilitate advancements in video understanding research by offering a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of MLLMs."

Despite their strong generalization capabilities, SAMs encounter challenges in fine-grained detail segmentation for high-resolution class-independent segmentation (HRCS), due to the limitations in the direct processing of high-resolution inputs and low-resolution mask predictions, and the reliance on accurate manual prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MGD-SAM2 which integrates SAM2 with multi-view feature interaction between a global image and local patches to achieve precise segmentation. MGD-SAM2 incorporates the pre-trained SAM2 with four novel modules: the Multi-view Perception Adapter (MPAdapter), the Multi-view Complementary Enhancement Module (MCEM), the Hierarchical Multi-view Interaction Module (HMIM), and the Detail Refinement Module (DRM). Specifically, we first introduce MPAdapter to adapt the SAM2 encoder for enhanced extraction of local details and global semantics in HRCS images. Then, MCEM and HMIM are proposed to further exploit local texture and global context by aggregating multi-view features within and across multi-scales. Finally, DRM is designed to generate gradually restored high-resolution mask predictions, compensating for the loss of fine-grained details resulting from directly upsampling the low-resolution prediction maps. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and strong generalization of our model on multiple high-resolution and normal-resolution datasets.

This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language.

It is motivated in terms of Bayesian inference, as hidden states and parameters are optimised via gradient descent on variational free energy. However, implementations of PC rely on maximum \textit{a posteriori} (MAP) estimates of hidden states and maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters, limiting their ability to quantify epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we investigate a Bayesian extension to PC that estimates a posterior distribution over network parameters. This approach, termed Bayesian Predictive coding (BPC), preserves the locality of PC and results in closed-form Hebbian weight updates. Compared to PC, our BPC algorithm converges in fewer epochs in the full-batch setting and remains competitive in the mini-batch setting. Additionally, we demonstrate that BPC offers uncertainty quantification comparable to existing methods in Bayesian deep learning, while also improving convergence properties. Together, these results suggest that BPC provides a biologically plausible method for Bayesian learning in the brain, as well as an attractive approach to uncertainty quantification in deep learning."

By incorporating the denoising mechanism of the diffusion model, DenseFormer generates the dense depth map by progressively refining an initial random depth distribution through multiple iterations. We propose a feature extraction module that leverages a feature pyramid structure, along with multi-layer deformable attention, to effectively extract and integrate features from sparse depth maps and RGB images, which serve as the guiding condition for the diffusion process. Additionally, this paper presents a depth refinement module that applies multi-step iterative refinement across various ranges to the dense depth results generated by the diffusion process. The module utilizes image features enriched with multi-scale information and sparse depth input to further enhance the accuracy of the predicted depth map. Extensive experiments on the KITTI outdoor scene dataset demonstrate that DenseFormer outperforms classical depth completion methods."

Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the treatment of NSCLC patients with activating and T790M resistance EGFR mutations. Despite its established efficacy, drug resistance poses a significant challenge for patients to fully benefit from osimertinib. The absence of a standard tool to accurately predict TKI resistance, including that of osimertinib, remains a critical obstacle. To bridge this gap, in this study, we developed an interpretable multimodal machine learning model designed to predict patient resistance to osimertinib among late-stage NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations, achieving a c-index of 0.82 on a multi-institutional dataset. This machine learning model harnesses readily available data routinely collected during patient visits and medical assessments to facilitate precision lung cancer management and informed treatment decisions. By integrating various data types such as histology images, next generation sequencing (NGS) data, demographics data, and clinical records, our multimodal model can generate well-informed recommendations. Our experiment results also demonstrated the superior performance of the multimodal model over single modality models (c-index 0.82 compared with 0.75 and 0.77), thus underscoring the benefit of combining multiple modalities in patient outcome prediction."

What's worse, existing defenses are mostly designed under independent-and-identically-distributed (iid) settings, hence neglecting the fundamental non-iid characteristic of FL. Here we propose FLBuff for tackling backdoor attacks even under non-iids. The main challenge for such defenses is that non-iids bring benign and malicious updates closer, hence harder to separate. FLBuff is inspired by our insight that non-iids can be modeled as omni-directional expansion in representation space while backdoor attacks as uni-directional. This leads to the key design of FLBuff, i.e., a supervised-contrastive-learning model extracting penultimate-layer representations to create a large in-between buffer layer.

The sound generation module leverages a conditional diffusion model, which takes multiscale features rendered from a feature-augmented 3DGS to generate realistic hitting sounds. Meanwhile, the sound localization module enables querying the 3D scene, represented by the feature-augmented 3DGS, to localize hitting positions based on the sound sources. To support this framework, we introduce a novel pipeline for collecting scene-level visual-sound sample pairs, achieving alignment between captured images, impact locations, and corresponding sounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to connect visual and acoustic signals in a 3D context. Extensive experiments on our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Visual Acoustic Fields in generating plausible impact sounds and accurately localizing impact sources.

However, deployment remains a critical challenge due to complex environment configurations, dependency conflicts, cross-platform adaptation, and debugging difficulties, which hinder automation and adoption. This paper introduces AI2Agent, an end-to-end framework that automates AI project deployment through guideline-driven execution, self-adaptive debugging, and case \& solution accumulation. AI2Agent dynamically analyzes deployment challenges, learns from past cases, and iteratively refines its approach, significantly reducing human intervention. To evaluate its effectiveness, we conducted experiments on 30 AI deployment cases, covering TTS, text-to-image generation, image editing, and other AI applications. Results show that AI2Agent significantly reduces deployment time and improves success rates. The code and demo video are now publicly accessible."
98,Harnessing the Reasoning Economy: A Survey of Efficient Reasoning for Large Language Models,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24377v1,0.9299999999999999,10,"cs.CL, cs.AI",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their ability to perform complex reasoning tasks, transitioning from fast and intuitive thinking (System 1) to slow and deep reasoning (System 2). While System 2 reasoning improves task accuracy, it often incurs substantial computational costs due to its slow thinking nature and inefficient or unnecessary reasoning behaviors. In contrast, System 1 reasoning is computationally efficient but leads to suboptimal performance. Consequently, it is critical to balance the trade-off between performance (benefits) and computational costs (budgets), giving rise to the concept of reasoning economy. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of reasoning economy in both the post-training and test-time inference stages of LLMs, encompassing i) the cause of reasoning inefficiency, ii) behavior analysis of different reasoning patterns, and iii) potential solutions to achieve reasoning economy. By offering actionable insights and highlighting open challenges, we aim to shed light on strategies for improving the reasoning economy of LLMs, thereby serving as a valuable resource for advancing research in this evolving area. We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this fast-evolving field."

100,Intrinsically-Motivated Humans and Agents in Open-World Exploration,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23631v1,0.91,6,cs.AI,2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"What drives exploration? Understanding intrinsic motivation is a long-standing challenge in both cognitive science and artificial intelligence; numerous objectives have been proposed and used to train agents, yet there remains a gap between human and agent exploration. We directly compare adults, children, and AI agents in a complex open-ended environment, Crafter, and study how common intrinsic objectives: Entropy, Information Gain, and Empowerment, relate to their behavior. We find that only Entropy and Empowerment are consistently positively correlated with human exploration progress, indicating that these objectives may better inform intrinsic reward design for agents. Furthermore, across agents and humans we observe that Entropy initially increases rapidly, then plateaus, while Empowerment increases continuously, suggesting that state diversity may provide more signal in early exploration, while advanced exploration should prioritize control. Finally, we find preliminary evidence that private speech utterances, and particularly goal verbalizations, may aid exploration in children."
