1,Pro-Routing: Proactive Routing of Autonomous Multi-Capacity Robots for Pickup-and-Delivery Tasks,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24325v1,1.44,2,"cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.MA",2025-03-31,2025-03-31,"We consider a multi-robot setting, where we have a fleet of multi-capacity autonomous robots that must service spatially distributed pickup-and-delivery requests with fixed maximum wait times. Requests can be either scheduled ahead of time or they can enter the system in real-time. In this setting, stability for a routing policy is defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time. Most previous work either solve the problem offline to theoretically maintain stability or they consider dynamically arriving requests at the expense of the theoretical guarantees on stability. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by proposing a novel proactive rollout-based routing framework that adapts to real-time demand while still provably maintaining the stability of the learned routing policy. We derive provable stability guarantees for our method by proposing a fleet sizing algorithm that obtains a sufficiently large fleet that ensures stability by construction. To validate our theoretical results, we consider a case study on real ride requests for Harvard's evening Van System. We also evaluate the performance of our framework using the currently deployed smaller fleet size. In this smaller setup, we compare against the currently deployed routing algorithm, greedy heuristics, and Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search-based algorithms. Our empirical results show that our framework maintains stability when we use the sufficiently large fleet size found in our theoretical results. For the smaller currently deployed fleet size, our method services 6% more requests than the closest baseline while reducing median passenger wait times by 33%."
